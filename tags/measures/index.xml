      <description>How is #ClimateChange affecting Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand?#IPCC author Michael Grose explains findings from the #ClimateReport released in 2021.
Since the early 20th century, the climate in Australasia has warmed by around:

      <description>This proposed pilot program would assist a whole community to make the switch; that is, generously subsidise and support participating households to go electric in six important ways. &amp;quot;By electrifying households, deploying even more rooftop solar, and installing household batteries, these emissions can fall to zero ‚Äì that‚Äôs real zero, not net zero ‚Äì by the end of the decade&amp;quot;. Well said, @GriffithSaul!https://t.co/TLwG4FnqGM
&amp;mdash; Brighte (@brighteAU) October 12, 2022 The exact details of the program are still being determined, but could look something like this:</description>

      <description>How do we fit in with other initiatives?
Suburb Zero Pilot and the National Electrification Program (NEP) The smart-energy transition and household electrification will lead to lower bills, fewer emissions and more jobs.
I advocate an Australia-wide National Electrification Program (NEP), starting with a demonstration project in Canberra to create the world‚Äôs first fully electrified suburb, to be developed in conjunction with Saul Griffith and Rewiring Australia.
The ‚ÄòSuburb Zero‚Äô trial would see $20 million of federal government funding leverage $50 million of private sector capital for a two-year, opt-in pilot program that guarantees participating Canberran households a 20-25 per cent saving per year on their fuel and energy bills.</description>

      <title>six things to electrify:</title>

      <description>Six things to electrify: Rooftop solar Solar panels mean your home can generate its own power. Rooftop solar electricity is about five times cheaper than grid prices. A home battery Solar panels can charge up a home battery while the sun shines. Then the battery can help power your home through the evening. (You&amp;rsquo;re still connected to the grid for cloudy days when you need more energy.) Cooking Induction cooking uses around half the energy required by fossil fuel methods.</description>
