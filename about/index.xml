      <description>We need to decarbonise quickly. The intensity and number of floods and fires in Australia is on line with predictions from past climate models from the CSIRO and IPCC. A lot of dedicated clever people have strived for decades on the science of climate change. These models have been constantly refined and tested against reality.

      <description>Saul Griffith argues that ClimateChange mitigation is an investment.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll end up saving a huge amount ‚Ä¶ in Australia, we would be saving about $40 billion a year by the end of the decade if we go down this electrification route.‚Äù
&amp;quot;We can achieve 50% emissions reductions by 2030 in our domestic economy by investing in households and small businesses, and they are real, achievable emissions reductions...&amp;quot;#climate #energy #auspol #hydrogen https://t.</description>

      <description>How do we fit in with other initiatives?
Suburb Zero Pilot and the National Electrification Program (NEP) The smart-energy transition and household electrification will lead to lower bills, fewer emissions and more jobs.
I advocate an Australia-wide National Electrification Program (NEP), starting with a demonstration project in Canberra to create the world‚Äôs first fully electrified suburb, to be developed in conjunction with Saul Griffith and Rewiring Australia.
The ‚ÄòSuburb Zero‚Äô trial would see $20 million of federal government funding leverage $50 million of private sector capital for a two-year, opt-in pilot program that guarantees participating Canberran households a 20-25 per cent saving per year on their fuel and energy bills.</description>

      <description>Six things to electrify: Rooftop solar Solar panels mean your home can generate its own power. Rooftop solar electricity is about five times cheaper than grid prices. A home battery Solar panels can charge up a home battery while the sun shines. Then the battery can help power your home through the evening. (You&amp;rsquo;re still connected to the grid for cloudy days when you need more energy.) Cooking Induction cooking uses around half the energy required by fossil fuel methods.</description>
