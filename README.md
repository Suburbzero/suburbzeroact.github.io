#### Quick Start for contributors
* Changes to the text are made to md files in the content folder.
* md files are a slightly augmented  markdown format
* unfamiliar formatting  can be played with but only if you are prepared to undo or  repair (it's not that scary)
* because this is git. EVERYTHING is version controlled. There are very few undo-able actions - except for the time
