 The financial structure can be designed to include everyone in the community by replacing gas and grid electricity with cheap, locally produced solar. To make this work, all households would need to sign up to an electricity retailer that is participating in the pilot. The retailer would offer reduced bills, regardless of how much rewiring a household is able to participate in. 
 
 **People such as renters in flats can still sign up to a pilot and receive cheaper electricity.**
