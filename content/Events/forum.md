Following the approach of 'Electrify 2515', inventor and author Saul Griffith's home suburb in northern Illawarra, the ACT will be trialing a pilot project to demonstrate electrification of an existing suburb.

The yet-to-be-chosen Canberra suburb will have its own set of unique challenges and will include multi-occupant dwellings, social housing and stand-alone residences.

The trial seeks to test solutions to the social, technological, regulatory and economic challenges associated with rapid decarbonisation of existing housing and apartments. The pilot also seeks to demonstrate full, retro-fitted, electrification of large, complex buildings, cold climate electrification and smart technology integration.
