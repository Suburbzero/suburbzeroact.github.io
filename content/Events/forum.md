Thank you to the over 600 people who came on Friday night for our big launch. As you would have heard on the night, Senator Pocock, Saul Griffith, and our team were blown away by the support for our Suburb Zero: Electrify Canberra initiative.

The theatre was buzzing, and the enthusiasm was palpable!


A big thank you to the Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program at the ANU for hosting.

As we all know, the key to success is getting funding. So, let's start chatting with our other ACT Senator and Minister for Finance, Senator Katy Gallagher.

Following the approach of 'Electrify 2515', inventor and author Saul Griffith's home suburb in northern Illawarra, the ACT will be trialing a pilot project to demonstrate electrification of an existing suburb.

The yet-to-be-chosen Canberra suburb will have its own set of unique challenges and will include multi-occupant dwellings, social housing and stand-alone residences.

The trial seeks to test solutions to the social, technological, regulatory and economic challenges associated with rapid decarbonisation of existing housing and apartments. The pilot also seeks to demonstrate full, retro-fitted, electrification of large, complex buildings, cold climate electrification and smart technology integration.
