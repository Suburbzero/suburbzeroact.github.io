#### Well that was great!
On Friday 21st April, Senator David Pocock and Saul Griffith officially launched Suburb Zero/Electrify Canberra at ANU. Over 600 Canberrans were energised by the discussion on why electrification is the answer and by the panellists painting a picture of what Suburb Zero could look like for Canberrans.

>We know household electrification can save families thousands of dollars. Electrification reduces emissions and can unite neighbours in a way that discussions on climate action do not.

>"Electrify Canberra is about bringing our communities together, building resilience. It's the conversations we have with our family, friends and neighbours at the kitchen table and at the tea station at work: getting an induction cooktop, switching to a hot water heat pump, getting off gas. Everyone should want to be part of it. It's a global game changer for everyday Australians and the planet. Itâ€™s such an exciting initiative. Let's Electrify Canberra!

Thank you to all the people who came on Friday night for our big launch. As you would have heard on the night, Senator Pocock, Saul Griffith, and our team were blown away by the support for our Suburb Zero: Electrify Canberra initiative.

The theatre was buzzing, and the enthusiasm was palpable!


A big thank you to the Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program at the ANU for hosting.

Following the approach of 'Electrify 2515', inventor and author Saul Griffith's home suburb in northern Illawarra, the ACT will be trialing a pilot project to demonstrate electrification of an existing suburb.

The yet-to-be-chosen Canberra suburb will have its own set of unique challenges and will include multi-occupant dwellings, social housing and stand-alone residences.

The trial seeks to test solutions to the social, technological, regulatory and economic challenges associated with rapid decarbonisation of existing housing and apartments. The pilot also seeks to demonstrate full, retro-fitted, electrification of large, complex buildings, cold climate electrification and smart technology integration.
