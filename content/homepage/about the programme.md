We are a volunteer-based organisation in Canberra that is passionate about electrifying and decarbonising our community. With the rising cost of living, we want to help you significantly reduce your energy bills at the same time.<br><br>


Through the help of our volunteers and climate policy maker, Dr Saul Griffith, we can navigate policies together with local politicians to electrify our communities.<br><br>

We want to subsidise and support participating households that are willing to electrify six things:<br><br>

(1) Hot water pump, (2) indoor heating, (3) rooftop solar, (4) stove tops, (5) household battery and your (6) cars.
