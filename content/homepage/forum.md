Suburb Zero is coming to the Australian Capital Territory! <br><br>

{{< figure src="/events/Forum 21st april.jpeg"   >}}
 At the launch on Friday 21st April, Senator David Pocock and Saul Griffith, inventor and author,  discussed how to help Canberrans electrify their households, save money and the climate.

 Are you inspired by the recent launch? We certainly were. It was a blast.  <br><br>
