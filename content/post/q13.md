####  Q13. How will this lead to savings in cost of living?

 Electrifying our homes will not only slash our emissions, it will also save households money on energy bills. By 2030 an electrified household will save on average  $5,000 per year on their energy and fuel costs. Currently lower-income homes spend nearly double their earnings on energy costs.[^2]
