 As long as more than 60-70% of freestanding households enroll, the pilot will be a rigorous test of electrification. The minimum grouping of homes would be around 50 houses that take power from the same distribution transformer. A larger pilot would aggregate households connecting to adjacent distribution transformers. The goal would be to scale a pilot so that it included every house connected to the neighbourhood substation, which feeds power to roughly 1,000 homes.
