 Yes, for a renter to get involved and reduce energy bills, they can work with their landlord to improve the capital value of their asset by upgrading to full electrification.  
   
 Tenants stand to benefit from the 20-25% annual energy savings, including the opportunity to lease and potentially own an EV.
