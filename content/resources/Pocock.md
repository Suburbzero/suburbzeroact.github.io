>to establish a national Transition Authority that will help workers and communities in fossil fuel reliant regions move to new careers and drive economic activity in the renewable energy sector;
for a **suburb-wide full household electrification pilot** (a trial for 1,000 homes in the ACT has been costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office at $11.3 million over the forward estimates) and to support the new ACT Government Home Energy Support Program to electrify low-income, social and public housing properties.
to reinstate the Household Energy Consumption Survey (abolished by the Abbott government) to provide timely and transparent data on expenditure on residential energy costs.
