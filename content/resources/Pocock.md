 Senator Pocock has asked the government to consider broadening the package to include funding:

>to establish a national Transition Authority that will help workers and communities in fossil fuel reliant regions move to new careers and drive economic activity in the renewable energy sector;
for a **suburb-wide full household electrification pilot** (a trial for 1,000 homes in the ACT has been costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office at $11.3 million over the forward estimates) and to support the new ACT Government Home Energy Support Program to electrify low-income, social and public housing properties.
to reinstate the Household Energy Consumption Survey (abolished by the Abbott government) to provide timely and transparent data on expenditure on residential energy costs.






>"David Pocock is a huge advocate for electrification, convinced it is the long-term solution to easing power bill pressure on Australian households. To prove it can work, he has asked the government to trial the electrification of a Canberra suburb.
>That means solar panels on roofs, heat pumps, batteries and so on.
>The Parliamentary Budget Office has estimated it would cost $11.3 million over four years to help 1000 households make the switch."
