| **Saul Griffith** | | | 
|    | “I’m astonished that there are 600 people here on a Friday night talking about electricity policy. This is an historic occasion and you have been part of something very special. “| | 
| **David Pocock**| | | 
| When asked  where all the gas is going?|  “We’re still being sold the lie that we don’t have enough gas. The potential shortfall predicted by AEMO - we loose 2.5 times that in leaks, flaring and waste so that’s not the problem “| | 
|   | “The cost of living is being felt across the country and the pension rises would be inflationary but here is something that is anti inflationary”| | 
|  | “How do we include low income households, social housing and units? That’s where pilots are important because they demonstrate the issues we can learn from.”| | 
| **Saul Griffith** | | | 
| | “In 2022 average Australian household spent around $20k (confirm if I heard that number right) over their life on energy. Savings of $3 to $4k annually if electrified through renewables and storage.” | | 
|   | “Pilots show that with better regs & education it’s possible and demonstrate the numbers. | | 
|    | “There is a global movement of positive environmentalism. We are showing that there is public demand for movement on this.”| | 
| **David Pocock**| | | 
| Why did Pocock buy in? | “He read the US book that Saul wrote and hooked up with Saul. One of you will have to get into politics to push this along. 4 or 5 months later he was asked to run for the Senate.”| | 
|   | “There has been a failure of imagination to articulate what we are for. Good air that doesn’t create asthma, inexpensive energy and things that are good for people. We need to push government at all levels to put people and places we love first “| | 
| **Saul Griffith**| | | 
| On Electrify 2515| “ extinction rebellion activists approached him for ways to progress climate activity that would get public support. They door knocked over 4000 people and over 1500 people responded. The idea has become popular in the public imagination and now they have around 200 messages in their inbox with people who want to lead their community “| | 
|  On the safeguard mechanism. | Saul Supports the safeguard mechanism “but it’s too vague  and complex for most people. We need simple action that the people can relate to. Even reduce reuse recycle sounds like colder, less and hard.”| | 
| **David Pocock**| | | 
| How is parliament house responding? |  Pocock is advocating  for it but ...“It’s hard because it’s a new idea, it’s an entrenched system and lobbyists. There are MANY lobbyists. “  But there are positive signs “At an event called electrify parliament it was the first time electricity lobbyists showed up - electric vehicles co, smart grid, batteries etc. “ | | 
|   How can we replicate the solar cell roll out in electrification? |  “Only a small percentage know how to get to zero emissions and we should all know how to. “| | 
|   Is there a cost to suburb zero? | “  $12m commitment from gov to underwrite 1,000 households. That’s not much $ in terms of the budget. That’s $12k per household. “ | | 
|   On pilots| “pilots to demonstrate the economics that it will unlock savings for decades are needed. It’s a relatively new idea that flips the way we’ve thought about energy supply for so long. | | 
|   What’s different to past projects?| “The commitments so far are big transmission projects that are out of sight and out of mind and it won’t produce as cheap electricity as using storage from your own batteries.“| | 
|   On pilots| “A pilot is the start of a new idea where we make sense of what is the problem and what do we need to achieve. What are our goals? Economically compromised  people usually miss out. Being suburb  based it can include local schools and the library and small businesses.”| | 
|   On suburb zero in the ACT?| “The grass roots is where innovation happens. The ACT is not playing on easy because it cold and we use heaps of gas and people really live in their neighbourhoods - they have local connections. “| | 
|    On electrification of the network| “A myth that electrification will blow up prices and the grid. The way prices are set is based on utilisation of the network so we can reduce demand and that will lower prices. There’s a lot of innovation through virtual power plants and automation to make demand response simple. “| | 
|    On electrification of the network| “Huge batteries will wash away the need for large infrastructure changes.”| | 
|  On electrification of the network| “ACT CBA shows The most cost effective option is a planned phase out of gas by 2035. “  CBA = cost benefit analysis?| | 
|    On electrification of the network| “ACT electricity peaks on our coldest day and so does gas usage. “| | 
|  On naysayers and degassification| “They say it’s going to be hard because they have vested interests. A planned retreat from gas is the only way to make it fair and possible. Berkeley tried to have no gas in new buildings but couldn’t get there because of the politics. “| | 
| **Sarah Reid**| | | 
| On  Suburb Zero ACT| Everyone in the group really connected with this idea.  Sarah was inspired by Saul a year ago.| | 
|  On community action| We are powerful when more people come together.| | 
|   On action| “Lobbyists are only effective if we let them be effective. The best antidote to despair is action.”| | 
|   About  (some) of  our team | Sarah worked on Pococks election campaign.  Mel started the group. Hilary graphics. Garry who did the website. Bobby our team electrician. Amy  brought expertise  and connections from Australian parents for climate action.| | 
|   How to get involved?| * go to the website.     * Scan the code and do the survey to boost the metrics and demonstrate interest for lobbying.  * Talk to us about action  * help us get the work out through     * letter boxing      * manning stalls at shopping centres,     * buying the T-shirt to fund them.| | 
|   Who should get help? Which suburb?|  “ACT will trail a suburb yet to be chosen”  “ It would be good to do it for people who find it hard to do it. “| | 
|   On which suburb|  The choice is important. You don’t want an old suburb that’s pre gas or a well to do suburb. Need a mix of building types. Apartments have limited access to solar and it’s hard to door knock apartments.  Tuggeranong often misses out. “| | 
|   On retrofittting| “Retrofitting is hard. “and “Need to train Sparkies. “  There are precedents  “There is a  US group called block power who do retrofits for low income apartment buildings. Need to retrofit 11 million homes.”| | 
|  On the grid | “We’re not reforming the rules fast enough. Alan Finkels sandbox mechanism may allows groups to reach agreements with (power) suppliers.” but still   “ We need community to push the boundaries of regulation. “ (of the grid)| | 
| **Sarah and Saul**| | | 
| Q&A What is the Timeframe? Will the outcomes be measured? | 2515 starts this year and hope to get some numbers over the next 2 years.  In canberra ASAP. | | 
| | Sarah and Saul:Q&A How would success of the pilot be determined?|  A lot of baseline data is privately held  by Energy companies (?) In NSW the DNSPs understand that they have to work with households whether private or government.  “The ultimate success will be driven by state & territory government.“ | | 
| | Sarah and Saul:Q&A: If the technology and financial outcomes where shared around the commons - is it possible to democratise this process? | All new structures are on the table. It’s why we should run multiple pilots using different models.  public spaces could generate 50% of electricity in our communities.  There is a collective project already.  Must consider if the community has the ability to take on the risk? There are potential pitfalls where we might do things which are not pro social. | | 
| | Sarah and Saul:Q&A: Is there a scenario where the suppliers pay for technology and people pay it back. | Yes. In the US it’s called ‘on bill financing’. Can also be done as rate based financing- done in California. | | 
| **Saul Griffith**| | | 
| Q&A: will this model provide better resilience to households in extreme weather & environmental disasters?|  Electrification will provide resilience. Must consider how we set up controls etc to maximise this  | | 
| **David Pocock**| | | 
| Closing remarks| “this is an idea whose time has come.”| |
