It has been a huge fortnight in Suburb Zero. We spoke at the Electrify Parliament event hosted by  Senator David Pocock and MP Allegra Spender. It was a fantastic turnout and Amy from our team gave a crackling presentation that really energised the room! Literally!!
 
 

The Suburb Zero campaign is being officially [launched]({{< ref "/events" >}}) by Saul Griffith and Senator Pocock on April 21st at ANU. We would love to see you there. You can register here. The event is free but seats are limited so get in while you can.

Saul Griffith was in Canberra to launch his Quarterly Essay. A group of our volunteers attended and Saul is now a proud owner of the Suburb Zero ACT t-shirt. You too can be like Saul and be the proud owner and wearer of one of these stunningly designed shirts. We will have them available at our official Suburb Zero launch for $40.
