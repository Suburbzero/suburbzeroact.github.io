Suburb Zero ACT/Electrify Canberra Official Launch

Last Friday (21 April), Senator David Pocock and Saul Griffith officially launched Suburb Zero/Electrify Canberra at ANU. Over 600 Canberrans were energised by the discussion on why electrification is the answer and by the panellists painting a picture of what Suburb Zero could look like for Canberrans.

We know household electrification can save families thousands of dollars. Electrification reduces emissions and can unite neighbours in a way that discussions on climate action do not.



"Electrify Canberra is about bringing our communities together, building resilience. It's the conversations we have with our family, friends and neighbours at the kitchen table and at the tea station at work: getting an induction cooktop, switching to a hot water heat pump, getting off gas. Everyone should want to be part of it. It's a global game changer for everyday Australians and the planet. It’s such an exciting initiative. Let's Electrify Canberra! - Sarah Reid, Community Lead, Electrify Canberra/Suburb Zero ACT 



Electrify Canberra/Suburb Zero ACT T-shirts (designed by talented volunteer, Hillary Lang), are available for $40 and you can also get a bumper sticker! Let me know if you are keen on getting hold of Suburb Zero/Electrify Canberra merch, and/or if you're interested in volunteering to bring the vision to Canberra.

If you weren't able to make the launch, you can watch the event here

Electrifying the Legislative Assembly

The Electrify Canberra/ Suburb Zero ACT Team had a great meeting with Minister Rattenbury and MLA Jo Clay last week to discuss what a Suburb Zero trial could look like in the ACT and the opportunities to explore the challenge of retrofitting apartments. We share the common aim of priorising social equity in transitioning our households and maximising the benefits to as many Canberrans as possible.

We know that Canberrans expect the ACT to be a national and global leader on climate action. The ACT is well on its way to electrification and we want to bring everyone along so that change is faster, bigger and sooner. Let’s show how we can bring all levels of government together, business, industry, and critically, community, and electrify Canberra!

If you haven't already filled in the Suburb Zero ACT survey, please do, we need to know the barriers, what's stopping you from electrifying your home?

Please also follow Suburb Zero ACT through our website and social media.

Saul - 
>I’m astonished that there are 600 people here on a Friday night talking about electricity policy. This is an historic occasion and you have been part of something very special.

What can we learn from the US?

* We might learn from  successful climate legislation enacted by Biden especially the IRA (2022)
* Emissions standards come into effect by  2030

 > [The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), signed into law on August 16, 2022, directs new federal spending toward reducing carbon emissions, lowering healthcare costs, funding the Internal Revenue Service, and improving taxpayer compliance. ]

We can go faster than the US because 

* We have a mild climate
* We have solar
* Renewables  are more competitive here 
* We can write policy more ambitious because we can afford to. US mainly uses tax incentives which is quite regressive


#### David Pocock 

When asked  where all the gas is going.
>“We’re still being sold the lie that we don’t have enough gas. The potential shortfall predicted by AEMO - we loose 2.5 times that in leaks, flaring and waste so that’s not the problem “

>“The cost of living is being felt across the country and the pension rises would be inflationary but here is something that is anti inflationary”

>“How do we include low income households, social housing and units? That’s where pilots are important because they demonstrate the issues we can learn from.”

#### Saul Griffiths

>“In 2022 average Australian household spent around $20k (confirm if I heard that number right) over their life on energy. Savings of $3 to $4k annually if electrified through renewables and storage.” 

“Pilots show that with better regs & education it’s possible and demonstrate the numbers. “ 

>“There is a global movement of positive environmentalism. We are showing that there is public demand for movement on this.”

#### David Pocock

Why did Pocock buy in? 

>“He read the US book that Saul wrote and hooked up with Saul. One of you will have to get into politics to push this along. 4 or 5 months later he was asked to run for the Senate.”

> “There has been a failure of imagination to articulate what we are for. Good air that doesn’t create asthma, inexpensive energy and things that are good for people. We need to push government at all levels to put people and places we love first “

#### Saul

On Electricity 2515 

>“ extinction rebellion activists approached him for ways to progress climate activity that would get public support. They door knocked over 4000 people and over 1500 people responded. The idea has become popular in the public imagination and now they have around 200 messages in their inbox with people who want to lead their community “

On the safeguard mechanism 

>“Saul Supports the safeguard mechanism but it’s too vague  and complex for most people. We need simple action that the people can relate to. Even reduce reuse recycle sounds like colder, less and hard.”

####Pocock

How is parliament house responding?
 
Pocock is advocating for it but ...

>“It’s hard because it’s a new idea, it’s an entrenched system and lobbyists. There are MANY lobbyists. “

But there are positive signs

“At an event called electrify parliament it was the first time electricity lobbyists showed up - electric vehicles co, smart grid, batteries etc. “


#### How can we replicate the solar cell roll out in electrification?

>“Only a small percentage know how to get to zero emissions and we should all know how to. “

#### Is there a cost to suburb zero? 

>“  $12m commitment from gov to underwrite 1,000 households. That’s not much $ in terms of the budget. That’s $12k per household. “

#### on Pilots

>“pilots to demonstrate the economics that it will unlock savings for decades are needed. It’s a relatively new idea that flips the way we’ve thought about energy supply for so long. “

>“The commitments so far are big transmission projects that are out of sight and out of mind and it won’t produce as cheap electricity as using storage from your own batteries.  Why are we prioritising “

>“A pilot is the start of a new idea where we make sense of what is the problem and what do we need to achieve. What are our goals? Economically compromised  people usually miss out. Being suburb  based it can include local schools and the library and small businesses.”

>“The grass roots is where innovation happens. The ACT is not playing on easy because it cold and we use heaps of gas and people really live in their neighbourhoods - they have local connections. “

#### On electrification of the network

There is 
>“A myth that electrification will blow up prices and the grid. The way prices are set is based on utilisation of the network so we can reduce demand and that will lower prices. There’s a lot of innovation through virtual power plants and automation to make demand response simple. “

>“Huge batteries will wash away the need for large infrastructure changes.”

>“ACT CBA shows The most cost effective option is a planned phase out of gas by 2035. “

>“ACT electricity peaks on our coldest day and so does gas usage. “

>“They say it’s going to be hard because they have vested interests. A planned retreat from gas is the only way to make it fair and possible. Berkeley tried to have no gas in new buildings but couldn’t get there because of the politics. “

 


#### Sarah Reed 

On  Suburb Zero ACT

Everyone in the group really connected with this idea.  Sarah was inspired by Saul a year ago.

 >We are powerful when more people come together.

>“Lobbyists are only effective if we let them be effective. The best antidote to despair is action.”

### About  (some) of  our team  

Sarah worked on Pococks election campaign.  Mel started the group. Hilary graphics. Garry who did the website. Bobby our team electrician. Amy  brought expertise  and connections from Australian parents for climate action.

#### To get involved 

* go to the website.
    * Scan the code and do the survey to boost the metrics and demonstrate interest for lobbying. 
* Talk to us about action 
* help us get the work out through
    * letter boxing	
    * manning stalls at shopping centres,
    * buying the T-shirt to fund them.

#### Who should get help? Which suburb?

 >“ACT will trail a suburb yet to be chosen”

>“ It would be good to do it for people who find it hard to do it. “

>“The choice is important. You don’t want an old suburb that’s pre gas or a well to do suburb. Need a mix of building types. Apartments have limited access to solar and it’s hard to door knock apartments. 
Tuggeranong often misses out. “


But  “Retrofitting is hard. “and “Need to train Sparkies. “

There are precedents 
>“There is a  US group called block power who do retrofits for low income apartment buildings. Need to retrofit 11 million homes.”

###  On the grid

>“We’re not reforming the rules fast enough. Alan Finkels sandbox mechanism may allows groups to reach agreements with (power) suppliers.”
but still
>“ We need community to push the boundaries of regulation. “




### Q&A. 

##### What is the Timeframe? Will the outcomes be measured?

2515 starts this year and hope to get some numbers over the next 2 years.
In canberra ASAP. 

#### Baseline data?

Privately held Energy companies?
In NSW the DNSPs understand that they have to work with households whether private or government. 
The ultimate success will be driven by state & territory government. 

#### Q: If the technology and financial outcomes where shared around the commons - is it possible to democratise this process? 
A: All new structures are on the table. It’s why we should run multiple pilots using different models. 
public spaces could generate 50% of electricity in our communities. 
There is a collective project already. 
Must consider if the community has the ability to take on the risk? There are potential pitfalls where we might do things which are not pro social. 

#### Q: Is there a scenario where the suppliers pay for technology and people pay it back. 
A: Yes. In the US it’s called ‘on bill financing’. Can also be done as rate based financing- done in California. 

#### Q: will this model provide better resilience to households in extreme weather & environmental disasters?
A: absolutely 

> Electrification will provide resilience. Must consider how we set up controls etc to maximise this 
Pocock- this is an idea whose time has come.
